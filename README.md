### 📜 My Story So Far
After an initial spark that launched my career in development, I fully committed to the **Java** ecosystem, and I’ve been leveling up ever since.

I’ve navigated everything from "old school" **Java 6** environments to the modern **JDK 21** peaks. Along the way, I became a "Data Whisperer"—**Oracle** and **PL-SQL** are my go-to tools for ensuring everything stays organized and high-performing under the hood.

Nowadays, my main focus is crafting sleek, reactive interfaces with **Angular**. I've mastered **Bootstrap** for rock-solid layouts, but I'm also styling with **Tailwind** and exploring the fast-paced world of **Svelte** for future-proof apps.
